Forgot to add the instructions to run the program:
1.You need to create text files with the name MemberInfo and BoatInfo
2.And then add your own file path in the code. You will find the code at the begining of the class Console.java in the package View:
File readMemberData = new File("C:\\Users\\Robin\\Desktop\\MemberInfo.txt"); // change to your own path
File readBoatData = new File("C:\\Users\\Robin\\Desktop\\BoatInfo.txt"); // change path to your own path
